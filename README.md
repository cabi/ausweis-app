# Ausweis App

Take a photo with your tablet and create a document with your name and photo.
Print it on magic-paper and you have entry to every place.

Example: [`Ausweis App`](https://cabi.github.io/ausweis-app/)

The site is created with github-pages.

## Usage

Open the url of the ausweis-app with your tablet.

Touch the Button `Start Webcam`. Allow the Browser to access your webcam. It should switch to the front-camera - if not, switch to the front-camera.

Place your face in the former grey box and push the `Foto aufnehmen` Button. Your picture is placed in the `Ausweis`.

Enter your `Name` and `besondere FÃ¤higkeit` in the `Ausweis`. The fields are normal input-fields that you can edit in your browser.

Pushing the `Ausweis drucken` Button open the Browser printing-dialog. You see only the `Ausweis` in the preview where you can print the page. Use the option `Print Backgrounds` in your print-dialog when you want the colour background in your print.
